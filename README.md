This is a basic recipes website created for practicing the basic html knowledge I have acquired up to this point from The Odin Project lessons.

When finished, I should have learned how to correctly use the following HTML tags:

 - !DOCTYPE, html, meta, title, head, body, h1... (headings), p, a, ul and li.
