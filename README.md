This is a basic recipes website created for practicing the basic html knowledge I have acquired up to this point from The Odin Project lessons.

I have created the page using only the following HTML tags:

 - !DOCTYPE, html, head, meta, title, body, h1... (various levels of headings), img, p, a, ul, ol and li.

 No styling has been applied.
